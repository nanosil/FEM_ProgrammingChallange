# A Finite Element Solver
---
### Goal
A set Matlab scripts to solve an FE Problem.

A data file of node locations, material properties, boundry conditions, and element types is used as input.

The output is the displacement field of the FE problem.
Can solve CPS3, Bar, CPE3, CPS4,and CPE4 elements.
Uses Matlab libaries to plot output as an edge and vertices graph.
